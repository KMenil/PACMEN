Pacmen Game:

For this project or a simple game called “pacmen” you can add one or more pacman that moves from edge to edge or all four corners of the browser, for How to Run Roadmap of future improvements License I believe it would be great if I would be able to add ghosts on this game and fruits as well, and make a simple version of pacman with border like maze from the 90’s, in the future I think my professor would like us to make that happen or something similar, rest assured that I would make a vlog while making the game for you to see.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76236743/110276912-22b3b700-800f-11eb-9190-24240c08ae30.png)
